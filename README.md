ASI Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning HRL
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is an extension of reinforcement learning where the learning process is divided into a hierarchy of sub-tasks. Each level of the hierarchy operates at a different level of abstraction, with higher levels focusing on long-term goals and lower levels dealing with short-term actions. This approach can improve learning efficiency and scalability in complex environments.

Below is a simple example of Hierarchical RL using Python. This example uses a custom environment where an agent has to navigate a grid world. The hierarchy consists of a high-level policy that sets sub-goals for the low-level policy, which performs actions to achieve these sub-goals.
